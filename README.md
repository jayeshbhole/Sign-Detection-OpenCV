# Sign-Detection-OpenCV-Python3
Pre-requisites:
    
    1. Python 3 
    2. OpenCV 4 (Python 3)
    3. Numpy

The project was to operate a robot with signs that are predefined. The code is working fine just for detection. The RPi version of the code will be uploaded soon.

The detailed explanation and logic is given in the pdf.

Make sure that the code is in the same folder as the images else specify the path to the images and change the code accordingly.
Add other signs in Black-White png format and customise the detection. :smiley:
